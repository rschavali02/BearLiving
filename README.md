## Why Was This Built

Many WashU students struggle with finding available sublets that match their preferences. This inspired the conception of BearLiving. On out platform, user can fill out a google form as a buyer or a seller, and utilizing google sheets api, we build an algorithm that takes into account the importance of difference buyer preferences to different seller offerings. We then email the buyer a ranked list of all available sublets with the seller's contact information, using JavaScript's NodeMailer, making the process easy and convinient for students.

Users can also join our waitlist for Updates!

## Technologies Used

This project was built in React with the MERN stack, using Next.Js, Node.js, and Tailwind.CSS. We use MongoDB as out backend to keep track of user data.
Users emails are stored in the backend, and then we email those users with their ranked list of best-fit sublets!

The website is also properly configured for mobile view as well.
